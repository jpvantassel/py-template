hvsrpy Documentation
====================

`hvsrpy` is a Python package for horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio
processing. It includes two main class definitons `Sensor3c` and `Hvsr`. These
classes include various methods for creating and manipulating 3-component
sensor and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio objects, respectively.

This package and the classes therein are actively being developed, so if you
do not see a feature you would like it may very well be under development and
released in the near future. To be notified of future releases, you can either
``watch`` the repository on
`Github <https://github.com/jpvantassel/hvsrpy>`_ or
``Subscribe to releases`` on the
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/hvsrpy/>`_.
